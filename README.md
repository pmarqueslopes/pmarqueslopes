 <summary><h3>âš™ My GameDev Journey</h3></summary>
  My journey in game development began during my studies at PUC Minas, where I gained a solid foundation in various areas of game creation, including game programming, 3D modeling, animation, rigging, level design, game testing, and texture painting. With this knowledge, I explored different game genres and styles.

Over time, I have produced several projects, including an arcade game, a simulator, and a simple RPG. Currently, Iâ€™m working on a multiplayer heist game, focusing on teamwork while having fun with friends

This journey has allowed me to continuously grow as a developer, honing both technical and creative skills to craft engaging and dynamic experiences.
